## Inspiration

My High School Calculus teacher had this physical game that we played in class. The game allowed us to work on basic arithmetic but also be creative with our solutiuons such as using factorials. There is always a solution if you get creative enough.

This was also one of the first webpages I ever made with my limited knowledge of coding at the time. You can find the original website at [Selan Dice Game - 2016](http://selandicegame.weebly.com)
